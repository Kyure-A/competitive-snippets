## What is this?

Snippets / Library for Competitive programming (mainly AtCoder).

## What functions does this repository have?

- Mex
- Euclidean Distance
- stack DFS (Depth-First Search) 
- BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Unionfind (Disjoint Set Union)
  - There are three types: one that can manage disjoint set of int, one that can manage disjoint set of pair<int, int> (using map, which is slow and impractical), and one that can manage disjoint set of type T.
- Topological Sort

These exist in this repository. More will be added periodically.
